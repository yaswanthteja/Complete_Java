# Java Architecture



- JDK, JRE, and JVM are essential components of the Java platform, each serving a distinct purpose. Here are the key differences between them:

1. JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is used by developers to write, compile, and debug Java code.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): End-users use the JRE to run Java applications.
3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is the runtime engine that executes Java bytecode, and it is included in both the JDK and the JRE.

### JDK vs JRE vs JVM


| Term    | Full Form                | What It Does                              | Who Uses It              | Contains               |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **JVM** | Java Virtual Machine     | Runs `.class` files (bytecode)            | **End-user** & Developer | Part of JRE            |
| **JRE** | Java Runtime Environment | Provides environment to run Java programs | **End-user**             | JVM + Libraries        |
| **JDK** | Java Development Kit     | Used to **write and compile** Java code   | **Developer**            | JRE + Compiler + Tools |




### 1.  JDK (Java Development Kit)
 - The complete toolset for Java developers.

 - Contains everything in JRE plus:

    - javac (Java compiler)

    - Debuggers (jdb)

   - Documentation tools (javadoc)

   - Packaging tools (jar)

- If you're writing Java code, you need the JDK.




### 2.  JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
 - Allows you to run Java apps, but not compile them.

- Contains:

    - JVM

    - Pre-built Java class libraries (like java.lang, java.util, etc.)

- If you're just running Java programs (like Minecraft), you only need JRE.



### 3.  JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
 -  Core component that executes Java bytecode (.class files).

 - Converts bytecode → machine code for your OS.

 - Every platform has its own JVM version (Windows JVM, Linux JVM…).

## Common Interview Questions 

### 1. Are JDK, JRE, and JVM OS/Platform Specific or Same Across Platforms?
Answer:
Yes, JDK, JRE, and JVM are platform/OS specific — but they work the same way on every platform.

### 2. Why Are They Platform Specific?
- Because each operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) has:

- Different machine code instructions

- Different system architecture

- Different file and memory handling

- So, Java tools (JDK, JRE, JVM) need to be compiled for each OS.

### Behind the Scenes:
- When you download Java from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [AdoptOpenJDK:](https://adoptium.net/)

- You pick the version for Windows, macOS, or Linux

- **Internally, they all follow the same structure, but are compiled differently**

### 3. BUT Bytecode is Platform Independent!
```
 Java Source Code (.java) → Compiled with javac → Bytecode (.class) 
      ⬇️                                             ⬇️
 Platform-specific Compiler  →          Platform-independent Bytecode 

```
- So your .class files can run on any platform that has a compatible JVM.

| Component           | OS-Specific | Reason                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| JVM                 | ✅ Yes       | Converts bytecode to machine code for the OS    |
| JRE                 | ✅ Yes       | Contains OS-specific JVM and libraries          |
| JDK                 | ✅ Yes       | Built for each OS — includes JRE & tools        |
| Bytecode (`.class`) | ❌ No        | Platform-independent — runs anywhere with a JVM |



#### Java is platform-independent at the bytecode level, but the tools used to compile and run Java (JDK, JRE, JVM) are platform-specific.

## JVM ARCHITECTURE

It is very important, as a programmer, that we know the architecture of the particular programming language we use, as it enables us to write code more efficiently. To run any programing language applications, an application-based or process-based virtual machine acts as a run time engine, which analyzes the bytecode, interprets the code, and executes it. For E.g. JVM acts as a run time engine to run java based applications.


Java is developed with the concept of WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). A programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system easily because of Java Virtual Machine(JVM).JVM is an application-based VM, which is a part of the Java Run Time Environment(JRE) and is responsible to load and run java class files. JVM is the one which calls the main method of a java program.





<img width="1294" height="729" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eada6085-ca45-4a8a-ac20-435d73592778" />


# ☕ JVM Architecture 

Java's core philosophy is **WORA** – *Write Once, Run Anywhere*. This is made possible because of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

JVM is part of JRE and is responsible for:
- Loading `.class` files
- Managing memory
- Executing bytecode

---

## 🧱 JVM is divided into 3 Main Subsystems:

1. **Class Loader Subsystem**
2. **Memory Area Subsystem**
3. **Execution Engine**

---

# 🧠 JVM Internal Components



## 1. What is the ClassLoader subsystem?

- The ClassLoader Subsystem in Java is part of the JVM that is responsible for:

- Loading .class files (compiled bytecode)

- Linking them into memory

- Initializing class-level data (like static variables)

When a Java program runs, the ClassLoader takes the .class files and brings them into the Method Area of the JVM memory so they can be used during execution.
Java provides this functionality through an abstract class called java.lang.ClassLoader.

### Three Principles of Java ClassLoader

1. Delegation Hierarchy Principle
   - The ClassLoader first asks its parent to load a class.

   - If the parent can’t find it, then the current ClassLoader will try to load it.

   - This avoids loading the same class multiple times and protects core Java classes from being overridden.

2. Visibility Principle
   - A child ClassLoader can access classes loaded by its parent.

   - But the parent cannot see or access classes loaded by the child.

   - This ensures modularity and prevents conflicts between libraries or modules.

3. Uniqueness Principle
   - A class is loaded only once in memory.

  - Even if multiple parts of the program use it, the ClassLoader ensures it’s reused, not reloaded.

  - This improves memory efficiency and avoids class duplication errors.


## 1. ClassLoader Subsystem:


The ClassLoader subsystem is part of the JVM that is responsible for:

- Loading,

- Linking, and

- Initialization
of .class files (bytecodes) into the JVM Method Area.

##  i) Loading


<img width="720" height="299" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/146b615c-1dc9-423d-b2ca-dbe564647ae3" />







### Loading Class Files into JVM (Memory Area of JVM)
🔄 Flow:
- .class Files (like Test1.class, Test2.class) are stored on the hard disk.

- The Class Loader Subsystem reads these class files and loads the class information into the Method Area of JVM.

- Then, the JVM creates a Class Object (of type java.lang.Class) in the Heap Area to represent the loaded class (e.g., Test1.class info, Test2.class info).

🧠 Purpose:
- This Class Object is not an instance of Test1 or Test2. It is a meta-object that holds metadata about the class (like methods, constructors, variables, etc.).

- It allows developers to use reflection to fetch class-level details during runtime.










- JVM reads the `.class` file and stores:
  - Fully qualified class name
  - Type (class/interface/enum)
  - Methods, variables, constructor info
- After loading, a **Class Object** is created in the Heap (`java.lang.Class`)
  - Only **one Class Object per class**, no matter how many times it’s used

### 🧬 Class Loaders (follow Delegation Model):
| Loader | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bootstrap Loader** | Loads core Java classes (e.g., `String`, `Object`) from `rt.jar` |
| **Extension Loader** | Loads classes from `lib/ext` |
| **Application Loader** | Loads classes from user classpath |

---

## 🔄 What Happens During the Loading Phase in JVM?

### 1. Reading the `.class` File
- The **ClassLoader** reads the `.class` file (which contains the Java bytecode) from the system.

### 2. Storing in the Method Area
The **binary data** of the class is stored in the **Method Area** of the JVM memory. This includes:
- The **fully qualified name** of the class (e.g., `com.example.MyClass`)
- Its **immediate parent class** (e.g., `java.lang.Object`)
- Other `.class` file details like:
  - Whether it's a **class**, **interface**, or **enum**
  - List of **methods**, **variables**, **constructors**
  - Access **modifiers** (e.g., `public`, `private`)
  - **Constant pool** (for literals, references, etc.)

### 3. Creating `Class` Object in Heap
- After loading the `.class` file, the JVM **creates a `Class` object** in the **Heap Area**.
- This object is an instance of `java.lang.Class`.

### 4. Purpose of the `Class` Object
- Represents the loaded class in memory.
- Can be used by programmers (via **reflection**) to access class-level information:
  - Methods
  - Constructors
  - Variables
  - Annotations
  - Modifiers, etc.

### 5. Only One `Class` Object Per Class
- No matter how many times you use a class in your program, **only one `Class` object is created**.
- This helps JVM follow the **Uniqueness Principle**, improving memory efficiency.


<img width="720" height="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d750d80c-938b-4871-bbe9-60a94bb8bf1a" />


###  Class Object is Created Only Once (Per Class File)

- No matter how many times you load a class, only one Class object is created in the heap for that .class file.
```
Test2 t1 = new Test2(); // Creates an object
Class c1 = t1.getClass(); // Gets Class object for Test2.class

Test2 t3 = new Test2(); // Another object of same class
Class c2 = t3.getClass(); // Still same Class object

System.out.println(c1 == c2); // true

```

### Output Result:
- c1 and c2 point to the same Class object (from the heap).

- Output is true, showing that JVM reuses the same Class object once the .class file is loaded.






- In the loading phase, the class loader reads each .class file and store corresponding binary data in the Method area. Below data are stored in the method area:
  a. Fully qualified name of the loaded class and its immediate parent class.
  b.  .class file information such as the file is related to class or interface or enum, methods information, variable information, constructor information, modifiers information, constant pool information, etc.

- After loading the .class file, immediately JVM creates an object for that loaded class on the heap memory of type java.lang.class.
- These loaded class “Class object” can be used by programmers, to get class-level information such as Method information or variable information, constructor information, etc. For every loaded type, only one class object will be created even though we are using the class multiple times in our program as shown in the below image.






##  1.1 Types of ClassLoader Subsystem in Java
The ClassLoader Subsystem in Java has three main types of class loaders, each with a specific role in loading classes into the JVM.

1. Bootstrap ClassLoader (also called Primordial ClassLoader)
  - Purpose: Loads core Java classes (like java.lang.String, java.util.*, etc.).
  - Location: Loads classes from:
  ```
  jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar
  ```
  - This path is known as the bootstrap classpath.

  - Parent: This is the topmost class loader — it has no parent.

 - Language: Implemented in native code (like C/C++).

  - Special Note: It’s not a Java object, so if you try to print it in code, it will return null.


2. Extension ClassLoader
  - Purpose: Loads optional libraries or extensions.

  - Location: Loads classes from:
  ```
  jdk/jre/lib/ext/*.jar
 ```
  - This is known as the extension classpath.

  - Parent: It is the child of Bootstrap ClassLoader.

  - Language: Implemented in Java.

  - Class: Represented by:
```
sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader

```

3. Application ClassLoader (also called System ClassLoader)
  - Purpose: Loads application-level classes (the classes you write).

  - Location: Loads from the classpath defined in the environment variable or IDE setup:
```
classpath / environment variable path
```
  - Parent: Child of the Extension ClassLoader.

  - Language: Implemented in Java.

 - Class: Represented by:
```
sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader

```

| Loader Type             | Loads From              | Parent                | Implemented In |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Bootstrap ClassLoader   | `jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar`    | None                  | Native (C/C++) |
| Extension ClassLoader   | `jdk/jre/lib/ext/*.jar` | Bootstrap ClassLoader | Java           |
| Application ClassLoader | Application classpath   | Extension ClassLoader | Java           |




## Working of ClassLoader Subsystem:
Now let’s discuss how these classloaders work in Java.




<img width="1845" height="853" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b40186b-fd13-4d23-882e-fd26463fb19e" />


1. Check if Already Loaded
  - JVM first checks if the class is already loaded in the Method Area.

      - If yes, JVM uses the already loaded version.

      - If no, it proceeds to load it.

2. Ask ClassLoader to Load
 - JVM asks the Application ClassLoader to load the class.

3. Delegation Hierarchy Starts
- The Application ClassLoader delegates the task to:

  - Extension ClassLoader, which further delegates to

  - Bootstrap ClassLoader
 

4. Bootstrap ClassLoader Searches

- It checks the bootstrap classpath:
```
jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar
```
- If the class is found ➝ it's loaded.

- If not found ➝ it passes the request back to Extension ClassLoader.


5. Extension ClassLoader Searches

- Looks inside:

```
jdk/jre/lib/ext/*.jar
```
- If found ➝ it loads the class.

- If not ➝ it passes the request to the Application ClassLoader.

6. Application ClassLoader Searches

- Searches in the classpath/environment variable path.

- If found ➝ class is loaded.

- If not found ➝ JVM throws:

    - NoClassDefFoundError or

    - ClassNotFoundException



### Java Code ClassLoader in Action

```

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // String class is part of the core Java API ➝ loaded by Bootstrap ClassLoader
    System.out.println(String.class.getClassLoader()); // Output: null

    // Test class is part of user code ➝ loaded by Application ClassLoader
    System.out.println(Test.class.getClassLoader());

    // Assuming Student.class is in Extension path ➝ loaded by Extension ClassLoader
    System.out.println(Student.class.getClassLoader());
  }
}



```


### Output

```
null
sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@18b4aac2
sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader@1072b4aac2

```


### Why Is null Printed for String?
- The Bootstrap ClassLoader is not written in Java and does not return a Java object.

- That’s why String.class.getClassLoader() returns null.





## Need for Customized ClassLoader

The class loaders in java follow the Uniqueness principle and load the .class file once only, even though we a program use multiple times the same class. Some cases say after loading the .class file, if the class is modified outside, then the default class loader won’t load the updated version of the class file(because .class file is already available in the method area.)

#### Problem with Default ClassLoader:

- Java’s default ClassLoader follows the Uniqueness Principle:

- A .class file is loaded only once into the JVM’s Method Area.

- If you modify the .class file after it’s been loaded, the JVM won’t reload the updated version.

#### Real-world Issue:
- Suppose your application uses a class Demo.

- You loaded it, then later updated Demo.class.

- But the JVM continues to use the old version since it's already in memory.

#### Solution: Customized ClassLoader
- By creating your own ClassLoader, you can:

- Force reloading of .class files.

- Control how and from where classes are loaded.

- Load updated versions every time they change on disk.



<img width="1551" height="802" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecc455fe-2269-43db-8515-9ffc4afe20c1" />


###  How to Define a Customized ClassLoader
 - In Java, you can create your own class loader by extending the java.lang.ClassLoader class.

-  Sample Pseudocode:

```
// Custom class loader definition
public class CustomizedClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    public Class<?> loadClass(String className) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        // Logic to load updated .class file from a custom path
        // Return the Class object after loading
    }
}

```

#### Example Client code

```

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This line uses the default Application ClassLoader
        Demo d1 = new Demo(); 

        // Now use the customized class loader to load the updated Demo class
        CustomizedClassLoader c = new CustomizedClassLoader();
        try {
            Class<?> updatedClass = c.loadClass("Demo");
            // You can now create objects or invoke methods from updatedClass
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```


- Even if the class was previously loaded, the custom class loader will allow you to reload the updated version.

#### When Do We Use Custom ClassLoaders?
- Custom ClassLoaders are useful in:

- Web servers (like Tomcat, Jetty)

- Plugin-based systems

- Dynamic application loading

- Hot-reloading features in IDEs





 ##  ii) Linking Phase in JVM

| Phase      | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Verify** | Ensures `.class` file is valid and secure |
| **Prepare** | Allocates memory for static variables with default values |
| **Resolve** | Replaces symbolic references (e.g., `"String"`) with actual memory references from Method Area |




Linking is the second step after loading and consists of **three sub-activities**:

### a) ✅ Verification
- Ensures the **binary format** of the class is **structurally correct**.
- The **Bytecode Verifier** checks if:
  - The `.class` file was created by a valid Java compiler.
  - The file follows proper JVM structure.
- This is a key reason why **Java is secure**.
- If verification fails ➝ `java.lang.VerifyError` is thrown.

---

### b) 🛠️ Preparation
- The JVM **allocates memory** for all **static variables** defined in the class.
- At this stage, the variables are assigned **default values** (e.g., `0` for int, `null` for objects).

---

### c) 🧠 Resolution
- JVM replaces all **symbolic references** (like names of classes, methods, variables) with **actual memory addresses** from the **Method Area**.

#### Example:
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = new String("Adwet");
        Student s1 = new Student();
    }
}
```

In the above code:

- ClassLoader loads Test.class, String.class, Student.class, etc., into the Method Area.

- All symbolic names (Test, String, s, etc.) are stored in the constant pool.

- During Resolution, these names are replaced with actual references from the Method Area.



## iii) Initialization Phase

- All static variables are assigned their original values (not just defaults).

- Any static blocks are executed in the following order:

   1. Parent class first

   2. Then child class

   3. Top to bottom order in the source code


Note:
- If any error occurs during Loading, Linking, or Initialization, the JVM throws:
```
java.lang.LinkageError
```

When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) takes care of loading classes, allocating memory, executing code, and cleaning up unused resources. The JVM is divided into several subsystems to manage these responsibilities:


## 2. 🗂️ Memory Area Subsystem

When the JVM runs a program, it divides its memory into five major areas:



Whenever JVM loads and runs a java program it needs memory to store several things such as byte code, objects, variables etc. Total JVM memory is organized into the following 5 categories.

i. Method area: For every JVM, one method area will be available. Method area will be created at the time of JVM startup. Inside the method area, class level binary data including static variables will be stored. Constant pools of a class will be stored inside the method area. Method area can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Hence, method area data will not be continuous.

ii. Heap Area: For every JVM, one heap area is available. Heap area will be created at the time of JVM startup. Objects and corresponding instance variables will be stored in the heap area. The Heap area can be accessed by multiple threads hence, the data stored in the heap memory is not thread-safe. The heap area need not be continuous.

iii. Stack Area: For every thread, JVM will create a separate stack at the time of thread creation. Each and every method call performed by that thread will be stored in the stack including local variables too. After completing a method the corresponding entry will be removed. After completing all method calls, the stack will become empty. The empty stack will be destroyed by JVM just before terminating the thread. Each entry in the stack is called a stack frame or activation record. The data stored in the stack is available only for the corresponding thread and not available to the remaining threads. Hence this data is thread-safe. Each stack frame contains Local Variable Arrays, Operand Stack, Framed Data.

iv. PC registers: For every thread, separate PC(Program counter) registers will be created at the time of thread creation. PC registers contain the address of the currently executing instruction, once instruction execution completes automatically PC register will be incremented to hold the address of the next instruction.

v. Native method stacks: For every thread, JVM will create a separate native method stack. All native method calls invoked by the thread will be stored in the corresponding Native method stack.







## Simply  we can say 

### i. Method Area
- Shared by all threads.
- Created at JVM startup.
- Stores:
  - Class-level data (including static variables).
  - Runtime constant pool.
  - Method and field info.
- Memory in this area is **not continuous**.

### ii. Heap Area
- Shared by all threads.
- Created when JVM starts.
- Stores:
  - Objects.
  - Instance variables.
- **Not thread-safe**.
- Non-continuous memory allocation.

### iii. Stack Area
- Each thread has its **own stack**, created when the thread is created.
- Stores:
  - Method calls (one per frame).
  - Local variables.
  - Return values.
- Destroyed once the thread terminates.
- **Thread-safe** (accessible only by the owning thread).
- Each **Stack Frame** contains:
  - Local Variable Array.
  - Operand Stack.
  - Frame Data.

### iv. PC (Program Counter) Register
- One **PC Register per thread**.
- Stores the **address of the current instruction** being executed.
- Updates after each instruction.

### v. Native Method Stacks
- One stack per thread for native (non-Java) method execution.
- Used to support calls to native libraries (e.g., C/C++ methods).

---

## 3. ⚙️ Execution Engine

Responsible for **executing** the bytecode loaded by the class loader.


This is the central component of JVM and is responsible to execute java class files. It mainly contains three components:

i. Interpreter: This is responsible for reading byte code and interpret it into sample machine code(native code) and executes the machine code line by line. The drawback of the interpreter is, it interprets every time, even if the same method is invoked multiple times, which reduces the performance of the system.

ii. JIT(Just In Time) Compiler: The main purpose of the JIT compiler is to improve performance. Internally JIT compiler maintains a separate count for every method. Whenever JVM comes across any method call, first that method will be interpreted normally by the interpreter, and the JIT compiler increments the corresponding count variable. This process will continue for every method. Once if any method count reaches the threshold value then the JIT compiler identifies that as a repeatedly used method(Hot spot). Immediately, the JIT compiler compiles that method and generates the corresponding native code. Next time JVM comes across that method call, then JVM uses native code directly and executes it instead of interpreting it once again so that performance of the system will be improved. The threshold count varies from JVM to JVM. JIT compilation is applicable only for repeatedly required methods.

iii. Garbage Collector: GC Collects and removes unreferenced objects.

Java Native Interface(JNI): This acts as a mediator for java method calls and corresponding native libraries i.e JNI is responsible to provide information about native libraries to the JVM.

Native method libraries: This holds native libraries information.



## Simply 

### i. Interpreter
- Reads and executes bytecode **line by line**.
- **Slower** as it reinterprets even repeated method calls.

### ii. JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler
- Boosts performance by compiling **hot methods** (frequently used) into **native machine code**.
- Maintains a count for each method.
- When a method crosses the **threshold**, it is compiled and reused directly.
- Threshold count is JVM-specific.
- Used **only for methods called frequently**.

### iii. Garbage Collector
- **Automatically deallocates memory** by removing objects with **no references**.
- Helps in avoiding memory leaks.

## 🔌 Java Native Interface (JNI)
- Acts as a **bridge** between **Java code and native libraries** (like C/C++).
- Enables JVM to call platform-specific functions.

---

## 📚 Native Method Libraries
- Libraries written in native languages (e.g., `.dll`, `.so`) used via JNI.
- Stored in system directories and accessed when required by native methods.
