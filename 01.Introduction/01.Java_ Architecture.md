# Java Architecture



- JDK, JRE, and JVM are essential components of the Java platform, each serving a distinct purpose. Here are the key differences between them:

1. JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is used by developers to write, compile, and debug Java code.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): End-users use the JRE to run Java applications.
3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is the runtime engine that executes Java bytecode, and it is included in both the JDK and the JRE.

### JDK vs JRE vs JVM


| Term    | Full Form                | What It Does                              | Who Uses It              | Contains               |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **JVM** | Java Virtual Machine     | Runs `.class` files (bytecode)            | **End-user** & Developer | Part of JRE            |
| **JRE** | Java Runtime Environment | Provides environment to run Java programs | **End-user**             | JVM + Libraries        |
| **JDK** | Java Development Kit     | Used to **write and compile** Java code   | **Developer**            | JRE + Compiler + Tools |




### 1.  JDK (Java Development Kit)
 - The complete toolset for Java developers.

 - Contains everything in JRE plus:

    - javac (Java compiler)

    - Debuggers (jdb)

   - Documentation tools (javadoc)

   - Packaging tools (jar)

- If you're writing Java code, you need the JDK.




### 2.  JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
 - Allows you to run Java apps, but not compile them.

- Contains:

    - JVM

    - Pre-built Java class libraries (like java.lang, java.util, etc.)

- If you're just running Java programs (like Minecraft), you only need JRE.



### 3.  JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
 -  Core component that executes Java bytecode (.class files).

 - Converts bytecode → machine code for your OS.

 - Every platform has its own JVM version (Windows JVM, Linux JVM…).

## Common Interview Questions 

### 1. Are JDK, JRE, and JVM OS/Platform Specific or Same Across Platforms?
Answer:
Yes, JDK, JRE, and JVM are platform/OS specific — but they work the same way on every platform.

### 2. Why Are They Platform Specific?
- Because each operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) has:

- Different machine code instructions

- Different system architecture

- Different file and memory handling

- So, Java tools (JDK, JRE, JVM) need to be compiled for each OS.

### Behind the Scenes:
- When you download Java from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [AdoptOpenJDK:](https://adoptium.net/)

- You pick the version for Windows, macOS, or Linux

- **Internally, they all follow the same structure, but are compiled differently**

### 3. BUT Bytecode is Platform Independent!
```
 Java Source Code (.java) → Compiled with javac → Bytecode (.class) 
      ⬇️                                             ⬇️
 Platform-specific Compiler  →          Platform-independent Bytecode 

```
- So your .class files can run on any platform that has a compatible JVM.

| Component           | OS-Specific | Reason                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| JVM                 | ✅ Yes       | Converts bytecode to machine code for the OS    |
| JRE                 | ✅ Yes       | Contains OS-specific JVM and libraries          |
| JDK                 | ✅ Yes       | Built for each OS — includes JRE & tools        |
| Bytecode (`.class`) | ❌ No        | Platform-independent — runs anywhere with a JVM |



#### Java is platform-independent at the bytecode level, but the tools used to compile and run Java (JDK, JRE, JVM) are platform-specific.
